# The Staff Engineer Archetypes

Will Larson defines four staff engineer archetypes. Understanding which one fits you is key to your promotion.

## 1. The Tech Lead
Guides the approach and execution of a specific team. You are the partner to the Engineering Manager.

## 2. The Architect
Responsible for technical direction and quality across a specific area. Focuses on system design and standards.

## 3. The Solver
Digs deep into rigorous or complex problems that others can't solve. Often deployed to "put out fires."

## 4. The Right Hand
Extends the reach of an executive. Focuses on organizational problems and high-level strategy.

## How to Get There
*   **Look beyond the code**: Solve business problems.
*   **Build consensus**: You can't do it alone.
*   **Write more**: Design docs, RFCs, and proposals are your new IDE.
