# The Deep Work Hypothesis

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.

## 1. Work Deeply
Make deep work a regular habit. Schedule it on your calendar and treat it like a meeting you can't miss.

## 2. Embrace Boredom
Don't reach for your phone every time you have a spare moment. Training your brain to be comfortable with boredom is essential for focus.

## 3. Quit Social Media
Or at least, be extremely selective about the tools you use.

## 4. Drain the Shallows
Minimize "shallow work" (non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks) to make room for deep work.
