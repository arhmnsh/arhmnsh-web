Google just announced Gemini 3.0, and it is a massive leap forward for agentic workflows. Instead of just "chatting" with AI, we are now entering the era of "assigning" work to AI.

## 1. Multi-Step Reasoning
Gemini 3.0 can now execute multi-step workflows without constant supervision.
*   **Old way**: Ask for a plan -> Execute it yourself.
*   **New way**: "Research X, draft a report, and email it to me."

## 2. Massive Context Window
The context window is now virtually infinite for everyday tasks, allowing for full codebase analysis.

## 3. Speed & Latency
It's fast. Really fast.

## Conclusion
If you aren't using agents yet, you are falling behind.
