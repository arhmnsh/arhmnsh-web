I still remember watching this for the first time in my room. I was surrounded by textbooks, assignments, and the overwhelming pressure to follow the "standard path", to get good grades, get a safe job, settle down.

But something about this resonated deeply.

> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

It wasn't just a marketing slogan to me; it was validation. Validation to be different. Validation to care more about *building* things than memorizing them.

During college, while others were optimizing for GPAs, I was optimizing for curiosity. I spent nights hacking together side projects, breaking code, and learning things that weren't on the syllabus. It felt risky. It felt lonely at times. People often don't understand why you won't just "follow the rules."

But looking back, that unconventional path was the only one worth taking. The misfits, the rebels, the trouble-makers. They aren't just disruptors; they are the architects of the future.

If you feel like you don't fit in the box they built for you, good. Don't try to.

Here’s to the crazy ones.
