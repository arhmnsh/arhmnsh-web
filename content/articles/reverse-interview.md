# Why You Should Interview Them Back

Most candidates are so focused on impressing the interviewer that they forget to assess if the company is a good fit for *them*.

## Key Questions to Ask

### 1. "How does the team prioritize work?"
This reveals if they have a structured process or if everything is a fire drill.

### 2. "Can you tell me about the last time a project didn't go as planned?"
This tests psychological safety and blameless culture.

### 3. "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
Clarifies expectations and shows you are goal-oriented.

## Red Flags to Watch For
*   "We work hard and play hard" (Translation: We work weekends).
*   Vague answers about company runway or financials.
*   Disrespectful behavior from anyone in the interview loop.
