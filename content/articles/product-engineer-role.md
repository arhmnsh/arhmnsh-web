AI made coding faster. Now product and design are the bottleneck.

Teams are shrinking. The two-pizza team is becoming one-pizza. When you can scaffold an app in minutes and debug with AI, you don't need five engineers per PM anymore.

What you need are engineers who understand *why* they're building something, not just *how*. Engineers who can talk to users, make product tradeoffs, and ship without a 10-page spec.

That's the product engineer.

They own the full loop: user problem → solution → code → measurement. They use AI to eliminate boilerplate, not to avoid thinking. The thinking is the value.

If you're an engineer optimizing purely for technical depth, you're optimizing for a shrinking role. The new leverage is product sense, design intuition, and the ability to move fast with judgment.

The companies winning right now have adjusted their talent mix. Fewer code executors. More builders who blend strategy with execution.
